    <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System supports playback of two consecutive XHTML Media documents, using a common MO file) if</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The next (second) page is properly displayed as an XHTML content</li>
        <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
        <li>If turned on, the extract on the second page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
        <li>After the full paragraph is read, the continuation of the text is on the third page, 
            and reading aloud continues when that page is displayed.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Reading System may automatically switch from the second to the third page without the intervention of the reader,
        and the reading aloud of the full text may happen without interruption; however, this feature is not required for this test to pass.
        Also, the Reading System may highlight the text being read with a green background with the text grayed out;
        this feature is not required for the test to pass either.</p>
