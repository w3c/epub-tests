        <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System implements Media Overlays on SVG content with associated styling) if</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on.</li>
            <li>If turned on, the extract on the next (SVG) page is read aloud by the Reading System.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By default, the text appears on top of a light gray cross pattern. The Reading System may 
            highlight the text being read by making the pattern disappear under the text 
            being read. However, this feature is not required for the test to pass.
