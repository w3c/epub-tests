    <title>Package processed with linked metadata record</title>

    <h1>Reading System does not skip processing package metadata when a linked metadata record is present</h1>

    <p>This test is only relevant if the reading system supports linked resources. If that is not the case, the relevant entry in the implementation report should be set to <code>null</code>.</p>

    <p>This epub contains both package <code>metadata</code> elements as well as a linked ONIX 3.0 record. The linked ONIX 3.0 record contains neither title nor creator data.</p>
    <p>This test passes if the Reading System displays the epub's title as <b>Package metadata title!</b> and displays the epub's creator as <b>Matthew Chan</b>.</p>
