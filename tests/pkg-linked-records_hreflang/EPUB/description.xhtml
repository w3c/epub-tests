    <p>The test describes a situation whereby the package file includes a <code>link</code> reference to this description. The link includes a <code>hreflang</code>
    attribute (set to 'fr', i.e., to French). This test passes if that language setting is <em>ignored</em> when rendering this description. This means that in the following quote:</p>

    <blockquote><q>Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien</q></blockquote>

    <p>the text must be surrounded by the usual quote characters (i.e., '"') as opposed to the '«' and '»' characters (which would be the French way).</p>
