    <title>H APPLE PIE</title>
    <desc>The text on top of the page says "H HAD IT". The drawing underneath is a child on the floor eating from a large plate of apple pie in what looks like the basement of a building. There are some jars in the corner with two mice and, on the right, part of a window pane of the basement.</desc>
