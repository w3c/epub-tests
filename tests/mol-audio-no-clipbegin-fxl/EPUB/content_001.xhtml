    <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System correctly handles the lack of a <code>clipBegin</code> attribute value) if</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
        <li>If turned on, the extract on the next page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
        <li>The audio does <em>not</em> start at the beginning of the text but at the title of the publication, name of the reader, etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The Reading System may highlight the text being read with a green background with the text grayed out;
        but this feature is not required for the test to pass.</p>
