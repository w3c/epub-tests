    <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System supports playback with XHTML Media document) if</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The next page is properly displayed as an XHTML content</li>
        <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
        <li>If turned on, the extract on the next page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Reading System may highlight the text being read with a green background with the text grayed out;
        but this feature is not required for the test to pass.</p>
