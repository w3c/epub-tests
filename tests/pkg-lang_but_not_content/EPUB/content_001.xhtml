    <p>Test passes if the following quotation is not surrounded by the pair '«' and '»' characters (used in French) but, typically,
      the '“' and '”' quotation marks.</p>

    <blockquote><q>Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien</q></blockquote>

    <p>
      Note, however, that the exact choice of quotation marks, in case the language is undefined (which is the case for this page),
      is not specified. While most of the browsers would use the '“' and '”' marks, others may base their choice on the 
      locale they run in. <em>It is therefore important to avoid running this test with an underlying locale language set to French.</em>
