    <p style="font-style: italic;">This test is only relevant if the Reading System does <strong>not</strong> support media overlays. Reading system supporting media overlays should ignore this test.</p>

    <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System ignores the attributes and items related to media overlays) if the extract on the
        next is properly displayed, without any interference in styling or audio effects.
