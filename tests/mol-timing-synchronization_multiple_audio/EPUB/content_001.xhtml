    <title>Media overlay test with two audio files</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System correctly handles a SMIL file with several audio tracks) if</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
        <li>If turned on, the extract on the next page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
        <li>The two paragraphs of the text are read without a significant gap between them</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Reading System may highlight the text being read with a green background with the text grayed out;
        but this feature is not required for the test to pass.</p>
