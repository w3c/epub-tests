  <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System plays an audio track from <code>clipBegin</code> to <code>clipEnd</code>) if</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
      <li>When turned on, the extract on the next page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
      <li>The full text is read</li>
      <li>No additional text is read (even though the audio file is longer than the text)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The Reading System may highlight the text being read with a green background with the text grayed out;
      but this feature is not required for the test to pass.</p>
