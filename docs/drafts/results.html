			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				This document contains the test results for all tests. There is a <a href="index.html">separate document</a> giving a short description for each tests; these descriptions are linked from the the tests in the tables below.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some implementations may come in different "variants": though they have identical core EPUB Reading system engines, their behaviors may slightly diverge 
				in different environments (typically IOS, Android, or Web) and, therefore, they are reported separately from one another.
				From the W3C Process point of view, these variants should not considered to be independent implementations and, 
				therefore, they should be considered as one implementation as far as the formal Candidate Recommendation report is concerned.
				On the other hand, implementors may see a value in keeping those implementation results separated.
			</p>

			<p>
				The report tables below reflect this duality. <a href="#sec-consolidated-report-tables"></a> shows a view of the reports where reports with identical core engines, albeit in different variants,
				are displayed as if it was a single implementation. The test results for a specific test is set to <code>true</code> if <em>any</em> of the variants has a <code>true</code> value. On the other hand, the separate <a href="#sec-detailed-report-tables"></a> keeps all the variants separate, showing the full implementation results.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="#sec-implementer-list"></a> lists all the implementations with the variant in parenthesis, if applicable.
			</p>

			<p>
				The development of the tests is a community effort (see the <a href="./index.html#contributors">list of contributors</a>). Everyone is welcome to
				contribute tests; please read the separate <a href="./contributing">contribution guidelines</a> if you are interested in doing so.
