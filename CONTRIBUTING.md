# Writing tests for EPUB 3.4

The [w3c/epub-tests/](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/) repository contains tests to validate the implementability of the
W3C's EPUB 3.4 specifications, specifically core [EPUB 3.4](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-34/) (the spec for the EPUB format
itself) and [EPUB Reading Systems 3.4](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-34/) (the spec for applications that read EPUB files).
Our objective is to test every normative statement (that is, every _must_, _should_, and _may_ statements).

Existing tests are described in the [generated test reports](#generated-test-reports).

This page explains how to write new tests.


## Prerequisites

* Install [eCanCrusher](https://www.docdataflow.com/ecancrusher/) or another utility or local script that can turn an EPUB
  folder into a compressed EPUB file.
   
   * On macOS, a command in Terminal can zip EPUB. Go to the folder containing the files and enter the following (replace `book.epub` with the test name):
   `zip -X0 book.epub mimetype; zip -Xur9D book.epub META-INF EPUB -x ‘*.DS_Store’ `

* Ensure you have several EPUB reading systems available to validate your tests (that is, validate that you have written the
  test correctly; many tests will nonetheless fail in individual reading systems). For example:

  * Apple Books (preinstalled on macOS)

  * [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download)

  * [EPUBReader for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/epubreader/jhhclmfgfllimlhabjkgkeebkbiadflb)

  * [EPUBReader for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/)

  * [Google Play Books for the web](https://play.google.com/books/uploads/ebooks) (uploads here will appear on other devices
    where you're signed into the same Google account)

  * [Kindle Previewer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765261)

  * [Kobo Books](https://www.kobo.com/ca/en/p/apps) ([instructions for sideloading](https://github.com/kobolabs/epub-spec#sideloading-for-testing-purposes))

  * [Thorium Reader](https://www.edrlab.org/software/thorium-reader/)

  * [VitalSource Bookshelf](https://support.vitalsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002383594-Download-Bookshelf) ([instructions for sideloading](https://support.vitalsource.com/hc/en-us/search?utf8=✓&query=side+loading+epubs))



## Step-by-step

1. Find an untested normative statement in the editors' drafts of [EPUB 3.4](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub34/authoring/) or
   [EPUB Reading Systems 3.4](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub34/rs/) specs to test — that is, a statement that does not
   have an expandable "tests" section like
   [Core Media Types](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub34/rs/#sec-epub-rs-conf-cmt). (Note that these links point at the
   working drafts of the spec on GitHub, not the published versions on w3.org; the published spec hides the "tests" sections.
   In the published versions, you can still see whether a statement is tested by checking whether its anchor element has a
   `data-tests` attribute.)

1. Claim the normative statement by [creating an issue](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/issues/new) in the
   [w3c/epub-tests](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/) repo. For example, see the issue
   [“Test obfuscated resources (fonts)”](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/issues/39).

1. If you are a co-owner of [w3c/epub-tests](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/), create a branch on that repo for your new
   test. Otherwise, fork the repo and create a branch on your fork. (It's easier for reviewers to clone a PR to validate the
   test if it's in the original repo.)

1. Within the branch, copy the [test template](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/tree/main/tests/xx-epub-template)
   (or the [fixed layout template](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/tree/main/tests/xx-fixed-layout-template) if you're
   testing fixed layout). Name your copy as explained in [naming](#naming) below.

1. Modify the template as necessary to implement the test.

1. Describe the test by adding the [metadata](#metadata) documented below to the package document.

1. Once your test is complete, drag the test's folder onto [eCanCrusher](https://www.docdataflow.com/ecancrusher/) to
   compress it into an EPUB file, or create a compressed EPUB file by some other means. (Or use any other means to produce a valid EPUB file.)

1. Open the EPUB file in one or more reading systems to verify it behaves as expected. It is common for reading systems
   not to meet requirements, but if you cannot find *any* reading system that processes the test as expected, that may
   indicate an implementation mistake in the test. Fix as necessary.

1. Run the EPUB through [EPUBCheck](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/) to ensure you didn't make any silly mistakes.
   Fix if you did. Your EPUBCheck version must be up to date; the program evolves with the specification…

1. Create a pull request for your test change, including both the uncompressed folder and the compressed EPUB file. Please
   ensure the PR's description clearly indicates which statement is being tested. Await review.

1. Once the pull request has been merged, fork the repo for the spec you are testing —
   [EPUB 3.4](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/blob/main/epub34/authoring/index.html) or
   [EPUB Reading Systems 3.4](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/blob/main/epub34/rs/index.html).

1. In the spec document, find the anchor element for the normative statement. If there is no anchor element, add one, using
   the same naming conventions as nearby anchors. Then add a `data-tests` attribute to the anchor element with the name(s) of
   your test(s) as comma-separated anchors:

   ```html
   <p id="confreq-rs-epub3-xhtml" class="support" data-tests="#doc-xhtml-support">
      Reading Systems MUST process
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-34/#sec-xhtml">XHTML Content 
         Documents</a> [[EPUB-34]].
   </p>
   
   ...

   <p id="confreq-rs-epub3-images"
      data-tests="#pub-cmt-gif,#pub-cmt-jpg,#pub-cmt-png,#pub-cmt-svg,#pub-cmt-webp">
      If a Reading System has a <a>Viewport</a>, it MUST support the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-34/#cmt-grp-image">image Core Media 
         Type Resources</a> [[EPUB-34]].
   </p>
   ```

1. Create a pull request for your spec change and await review.


## Naming

Test names should start with a three-letter abbreviation that corresponds to the value of the [`dc:coverage`](#metadata)
element below (for example, `cnt` for Content Documents, `pkg` for Package Documents, etc.), followed by a short hyphenated
identifier that makes clear which requirement is under test. For example, a test for
[the requirement for reading systems to support MathML](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs/#confreq-mathml-rs-behavior) should
be named `cnt-mathml-support`.

If multiple tests are necessary for a single normative statement, differentiate the test cases by appending an underscore and
a unique identifier. For example, a test that ensures reading systems treat explicit `dir="auto"` identically to omitting
`dir`, as part of the requirement to
[automatically handle base direction of the package document](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs/#confreq-rs-pkg-dir-auto)
might be named `pkg-dir-auto_explicit`.


## Metadata

The package document for each test must contain the following metadata, which is used to
[generate test reports](#generated-test-reports):

* `dc:identifier`: A unique identifier for the test (unique across _all_ tests). This is typically the test’s directory name.
  It is used as an anchor in the reports, so its format must be suitable as an HTML fragment identifier.

* `dc:title`: The title of the test. In general, this value is _**identical**_ to the value of `dc:identifier`, except for those cases when the subject of the test is the treatment of the value of `dc:title` itself (e.g., testing the base direction set on the title).

* `dc:creator` (may be repeated): Creator(s) of the tests.

* `dc:description`: A short description of the test for the generated test report.

* `dc:coverage`: Which section of the report the test should be listed in. The report has a separate table for each section
   to make it more readable. The current list of sections is listed in a
   [JSON configuration file](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/blob/main/docs/drafts/config.json); if you add a new coverage
   value, edit that JSON file in the same pull request to add the new value under the `coverage_labels`. That list should
   reflect the order of the corresponding sections in the EPUB specification.

   The element must carry an `id` attribute (usually `coverage`) that can be used for refinement.

* `schema:version` (part of a `meta` element refining `dc:coverage`): Must indicate the EPUB version being worked on by the Working Group at the time of creating the test. At present, this value must be 3.4. (This version identifier can be used to filter tests added to a newer version, as opposed to tests "inherited" from previous versions.)

* `dcterms:isReferencedBy` (repeated, as part of a `meta` element): A series of URLs that refer to the relevant sections of
   the specification. These links provide back-links to the relevant normative statements from each test entry in the
   generated report. The document references must use the documents' short name, i.e., `https://www.w3.org/TR/epub` or `https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs` (the scripts generating the reports will convert these to the actual versions or editors' drafts). Using these short names ensures that the tests always refer to the latest versions.

* `dcterms:alternative` (optional, as part of a `meta` element): Overrides the value of `dc:title` in the generated test
  report. This item is only necessary if the value of `dc:title` is _not_ set to the value of `dc:identifier`; in that case this value must be set to the value of `dc:identifier`.

* `belongs-to-collection` (optional, as part of a `meta` element): The value is `must`, `should`, or `may`, and it specifies whether the test corresponds to a  _must_ (or _must not_), _should_ (or _should not_), or _may_ (or _may not_) statement in the specification, respectively. If the metadata is not provided, or any other value is used, the default `must` value is used. 

* `dcterms:rights` as part of a `link` element: the rights associated with the test. Except for the rare cases the `href` attribute value should be set to `https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document` (i.e., to the W3C Software and Document Notice and License).

* `dcterms:rightsHolder` as part of a `link` element: the holder of the rights expressed by `dcterms:rights`. The `href` attribute value should be set to `https://www.w3.org/` in case the the rights value is set to the W3C Software and Document Notice and License, otherwise to a URL identifying the right holder.


In this example, only the relevant metadata items are shown (a test may have additional, test-specific metadata items). Note that the `dcterms:alternative` metadata is set to `pkg-dir_rtl-root-unset` because the test's subject is `dc:title`. In general, the value of `dc:title` must be identical to the value of `dc:identifier`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"

  <dc:description>
    The 'dc:title' element contains text whose proper rendering requires 
    bidi control. The element's 'dir' attribute is set to 'rtl'; the title 
    should display from right to left.
  </dc:description>
  <dc:identifier id="pub-id">pkg-dir_rtl-root-unset</dc:identifier>
  <dc:publisher>W3C</dc:publisher>
  <dc:title dir="rtl" xml:lang="he">CSS: הרפתקה חדשה!</dc:title>
  <link rel="dcterms:rights" 
    href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document"/>
  <link rel="dcterms:rightsHolder" href="https://www.w3.org"/>
  <meta property="dcterms:alternative">pkg-dir_rtl-root-unset</meta>
  <meta property="belongs-to-collection">must</meta>
  <meta property="dcterms:isReferencedBy">
    https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#attrdef-dir</meta>
  <meta property="dcterms:isReferencedBy">
    https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs/#confreq-rs-pkg-dir</meta>
</metadata>
    ...
</package>
```

(Note that, in this case, the `<meta property="belongs-to-collection">must</meta>` is not necessary, because that corresponds to the default value; it is only there as an example.)

# Running tests

Running tests mean loading each test, as a separate EPUB Publication, and check whether the reading systems fulfills the requirement of that specific tests. The results are collected in an implementation report file and uploaded to the test repository.

To make the running of the tests easier, a [test catalogue file](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/opds/opds.json) is generated using the [OPDS](https://drafts.opds.io/opds-2.0.html) format. Several reading systems understand this catalogue format, and can upload the full test suite easily.

## Implementation report files

The `reports` directory contains implementation reports in form of JSON files, one per reading system. The structure of the
JSON file is as follows:

* `name`: The name of the reading system.

* `variant` (optional): The name or properties of the reading system variant. Typical values may be `Android,` `iOS`, or `Web`, if one
  implementation (i.e., sharing the same `name` value) has specific versions running in those environments. In addition to the properties of the reading system, testers may also include information on how the tests were run, for example, if a screen reader was used with the reading system.

* `ref` (optional): A URL that creates a link on the name of the reading system in the implementation report.

* `tests`: An object with the list of the implementation results. Each key is a test's unique identifier (its `dc:identifier`) with a
  value of `true`, `false`, `"n/a"`, or `null` for a test that passes, fails, is not applicable (i.e., is not implemented for some reasons), or is not yet tested, respectively. If a test is not listed, or its value is considered to be `null`. The implementation report will show a value of "?" for `null`, indicating that the implementation has not run the test.

Here is an example of a small test report:

```json
{
    "name"  : "ACME Books",
    "ref"   : "https://www.example.org/acme",
    "variant" : "iOS, v1.0",
    "tests" : {
        "pub-cmt-gif": true,
        "pub-cmt-jpeg": true,
        "pkg-dir_rtl-root-ltr": false,
        "pkg-dir_rtl-root-unset": true,
        "pkg-dir_unset-root-rtl": false,
        "pkg-dir_unset-root-unset": true,
        "pkg-dir-auto_root-rtl": null,
        "pkg-dir-auto_root-unset": false,
        "pkg-linked-records": "n/a"
    }
}
```

The template file in `reports/xx-template.json` should list all available test identifiers, with all values set, initially, to `null`.


## Generated test reports

When new tests are committed to the repo, a GitHub Actions workflow generates a report from the tests in the `tests`
directory and implementation reports in the `reports` directory.

The report consists of two HTML pages, namely:

* A [test suite description](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/) that lists each test, split into one table per unique
  `dc:coverage` value. Each table has one row per test, showing the test's ID, title, description, back-links to the relevant
  normative statements in the spec, and links to the implementation results.

* An [implementation report](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/results) that lists reading systems that have submitted test
  results along with their results tables. Each table has one row per test and one column per implementation, with cells
  indicating whether the test passed, failed, or has not been run.
