/**
 * Entry point for the generation of the EPUB 3 test descriptions and test results. Running this script will
 * generate a number of HTML fragments containing sections with tables containing the essential metadata for each test,
 * the test results showing the implementation results for each tests, and it will also create an OPDS file that
 * may help to download and execute the tests.
 * 
 * The HTML fragments, to be stored, eventually, in separate files, in the `/generate/fragments` directory of the repository.
 * These fragments are included in the final report using the `data-include` feature of respec as follows:
 * 
 * - the `/index.html` file is the main entry point for the report, and it includes the description of each test with pointers to the specifications themselves, as well as a list of contributors;
 * - the `/results.html` file contains the results of the tests, listing the implementation results for each test and for each reported implementation.
 * 
 * The tests themselves are a collection of EPUB 3 books, each instance testing a specific feature of the EPUB 3 specification.
 * They are present both as EPUB 3 books, i.e., as zipped files, as well as deflated EPUB contents, i.e., as directories; all tests are available in the `/tests` 
 * directory of the current working repository. 
 * 
 * The implementation results are stored in the `/reports` directory. Each implementation 
 * report is stored in a separate JSON file, containing some metadata about the implementation, and the results of the tests. 
 * 
 * The `/generate/src/lib/types.ts` file contains, as part of the `Constants` namespace, the file names and directories for tests, final place for fragments, etc.
 * If the repository is reorganized or cloned, that file should be updated to reflect the new structure. 
 * 
 * Note that the current setup is based on release 3.4 of the EPUB 3 specification. See the separate `/generate/NewVersion.md` file for the steps to follow to
 * update the repository for a new version of the EPUB 3 specification.
