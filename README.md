# Test repository for the EPUB 3.3 specifications

This repository contains tests to validate the implementability of the W3C's EPUB 3.3 specifications, specifically core
[EPUB 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/) (the spec for the EPUB format itself) and
[EPUB Reading Systems 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/) (the spec for applications that read EPUB files). Our
objective is to test every normative statement (that is, every
[`MUST` or `SHOULD` or `MAY`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14), etc.).

The [test reports](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/) describe all the tests, including
[implementation results](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/results) and
[how to contribute](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/contributing).
