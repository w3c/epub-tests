# Test repository for the EPUB 3.3 specifications

This repository contains tests to validate the implementability of the W3C's EPUB 3.3 specifications, specifically core
[EPUB 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/) (the spec for the EPUB format itself) and
[EPUB Reading Systems 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/) (the spec for applications that read EPUB files). Our
objective is to test every normative statement (that is, every
[`MUST` or `SHOULD` or `MAY`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14), etc.).

There is a [document](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/) describing all the tests, with a reference to the implementation results, and ways to contribute.
